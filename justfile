# DynamoDB backend tests against DynamoDB Local, plus the DynamoDB half of the

# endpoint the dynamo tests skip, so `verify` still compiles and vets them (and
# runs the SQLite half of the conformance suite) — it just can't exercise the
# DynamoDB semantics (conditional writes, atomic counters, transactions) this
# recipe covers. The `dynamo` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml runs the same two
# packages against a service container.
