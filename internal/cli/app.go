sessions (each in its own tmux tab) hand tasks and messages to each other

agents already running on their own plans.

The binary has three modes: 'muster serve' runs the daemon, a lazy
unix-socket API server every other mode talks to; 'muster mcp' runs an MCP
stdio server exposing the daemon's operations as tools; every other command
is the operator CLI, a plain client of the daemon, exactly as capable as the
MCP tools.

Files: %s is the data directory (override with $MUSTER_HOME), holding
%s (the SQLite store) and %s (the daemon's socket).
